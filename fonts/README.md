# RSVP Nano fonts

This directory holds the offline font pipeline and the pre-converted `.rfont4` catalog used by the web flasher/companion.
The compiled Literata fallback is intentionally absent from this installable catalog.

`RFont4` is named for its primary packed 4-bit alpha coverage. Format version 7 stores three Alpha4 RSVP strikes and
one compact 1-bit strike in the same family file. Codepoints, Unicode page tables, a direct OpenType glyph-ID map,
and the generated script-capability mask are stored once per family; each strike contains only its metrics, kerning,
and packed pixels. Alpha4 glyphs are independently LZ4-compressed when that saves space, preserving random access;
the compact strike remains raw. The renderer finds visible spans after each row is read instead of storing duplicate indexes.
Older files must be regenerated.

Folder layout:

```text
third_party/
  atkinson-hyperlegible/
    AtkinsonHyperlegible-Regular.ttf
    OFL.txt
fonts/
  convert_alpha4_font.py
  generate_fonts.py
  index.json
  Atkinson Hyperlegible/
    font.rfont4
    OFL.txt
```

The generated fallback header is the one font artifact that belongs under `src` because it is compiled into firmware:

```text
src/fonts/
  LiterataFallbackAlpha4.h
```

`convert_alpha4_font.py` is the single-family compiler. `large`, `medium`, `small`, and `compact` default to
`52`, `43`, `33`, and `14` px. The compact strike remains 1-bit, but 14 px gives outline reader faces a readable
minimum comparable to the hand-drawn 8–10 px UI fonts. Override the sizes with:

```bash
uv run --with freetype-py --with fonttools --with lz4 python fonts/convert_alpha4_font.py \
  --font path/to/MyFont.ttf \
  --name "My Font" \
  --sizes large=56,medium=44,small=34,compact=14
```

`generate_fonts.py` owns the current source-to-preset mapping. With no arguments it regenerates every installable
font and the compiled Literata fallback, publishing only after every requested conversion succeeds:

```bash
uv run --with freetype-py --with fonttools --with lz4 python fonts/generate_fonts.py
```

Pass preset ids to regenerate only selected families, or use `--list` to show them:

```bash
uv run --with freetype-py --with fonttools --with lz4 python fonts/generate_fonts.py amiri noto-serif-japanese
```

Reader source binaries and their licenses live under `third_party/<family>/`. Generated files and the license files
distributed with them live under `fonts/<display name>/`.

Add `--shaping` only for fonts whose scripts require contextual OpenType shaping. It embeds the subsetted
GDEF/GSUB/GPOS tables and glyph-ID closure once in the family file; ordinary Latin/Cyrillic fonts omit both.

Use `--locales` only as font-selection affinity; it does not install UI strings or make the font depend on a locale
pack. `--scripts` explicitly declares complete ISO 15924 capabilities and overrides cmap inference, preventing
incidental glyphs from advertising a whole script. Add `Zmth` only for a font intended to provide complete Unicode
math coverage rather than a font that happens to contain a few operators:

The named reader maps `Hebr`, `Arab`, `Hani`, `Jpan`, and `Zmth` select only their required script codepoints plus
reader punctuation, digits, currency symbols, and bidi controls. They also declare their script capabilities, so a
duplicate `--scripts` argument is unnecessary. Unrelated letters from multilingual source fonts are deliberately
omitted.

```bash
uv run --with freetype-py --with fonttools --with lz4 python fonts/convert_alpha4_font.py \
  --font path/to/NotoSerifHebrew-Regular.ttf \
  --name "Noto Serif Hebrew" \
  --map Hebr \
  --locales he \
  --shaping

uv run --with freetype-py --with fonttools --with lz4 python fonts/convert_alpha4_font.py \
  --font path/to/STIXTwoMath-Regular.otf \
  --name "STIX Two Math" \
  --map Zmth

uv run --with freetype-py --with fonttools --with lz4 python fonts/convert_alpha4_font.py \
  --font path/to/NotoSerifJP-Regular.otf \
  --name "Noto Serif Japanese" \
  --map Jpan \
  --locales ja
```

Horizontal CJK fonts intentionally omit `--shaping`; direct cmap glyphs cover this renderer, while vertical layout
is outside the current engine. Arabic and Hebrew retain their compact GDEF/GSUB/GPOS sections.

Default output is `fonts/<name>/font.rfont4` plus an updated `fonts/index.json`.

Generate the built-in fallback header only when firmware fallback data must change. By default this writes to `src/fonts/LiterataFallbackAlpha4.h`:

```bash
uv run --with freetype-py --with fonttools --with lz4 python fonts/convert_alpha4_font.py \
  --font third_party/literata/Literata-Regular.ttf \
  --name LiterataFallbackAlpha4 \
  --header
```

Runtime behavior:

- The SD card catalog is built from `/fonts/<folder name>/` directories.
- Each folder contains one `font.rfont4` family file with Large, Medium, and Small Alpha4 strikes plus one Compact
  1-bit strike. Compact is selectable in RSVP mode and is always used for page reading and scrub previews.
- Optional GDEF/GSUB/GPOS shaping tables are stored once in that same file, never in a locale pack.
- BMP page tables map codepoints directly to shared render glyphs; only supplementary codepoints have separate lookup
  records. Identical bitmap payloads and kerning slices are interned within each strike.
- Japanese and Chinese families store one optional sparse vertical-rule section shared by all strikes. Upright glyphs
  have no rule, rotated glyphs reuse their canonical bitmap, and `vert`/`vrt2` alternates add pixels only when the source
  font actually supplies a distinct glyph. The section's presence is the capability signal.
- The selected family file stays open once. On PSRAM boards, shared lookup metadata and the active strike are loaded
  once when space permits. Otherwise, the 256-byte page map remains resident and the bounded block/bitmap caches
  service lookup data and packed rows from the file.
- Each bundled font keeps its license and any upstream font log beside its converted assets.
- Generated RFont4 files include the rasterized glyph closure referenced by their shared layout tables, preserving
  the source font's OpenType glyph IDs.
- Locale-pack U8g2 fonts live under `/locales/<id>/ui`, contain only fixed translated UI strings, and are never
  loaded by the reader. Arbitrary book text uses the selected RFont4 family's compact strike.
- If the selected RFont4 lacks a glyph, the renderer falls through to the compiled U8g2 font without loading another asset.
- Installing an RFont4 is sufficient to enable its reader scripts. Installing the matching UI locale is optional.

Validation is split deliberately: the converter and native tests verify complete generated assets, while firmware
checks the installed-file header and section layout before activation and bounds-checks each record it reads.
