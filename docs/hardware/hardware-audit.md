# Hardware audit

Compared the supported board implementations with revision-matched schematics, Waveshare
examples/BSPs, and controller documentation. The supplied report was a checklist, not evidence
that every proposed register change was correct. Physical verification remains separate from
host tests and firmware builds.

## Confirmed corrections

| Hardware | Correction | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AMOLED 1.8 V1/V2 | Correct EXIO0 LCD reset, EXIO1 display enable, EXIO2 touch reset, EXIO7 SD-CS. Recovery resets touch alone; failed startup sequencing propagates an error. | [1.8 schematic](https://files.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8.pdf) |
| AMOLED 1.8 V1/V2, 2.06, 2.16; C6 LCD 1.47 | Retain falling-edge touch notifications and wake the existing sampler. Consume pending work before I2C; preserve events during reads and retry failed reads. | Board-matched Waveshare Arduino touch examples, including the exact AXS5106L implementation for C6 |
| AMOLED 2.16 | Replace the unrelated CST816-family `FA 40` initialization with the CST92xx identification sequence. Reject corrupt markers/counts/IDs without manufacturing a release. | [2.16 SensorLib source](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16/tree/main/examples/arduino/libraries), [Waveshare components](https://github.com/waveshareteam/Waveshare-ESP32-components) |
| C6 LCD 1.47 | BOOT and its wake source are GPIO9, not GPIO8. | [C6 schematic](https://files.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-C6-Touch-LCD-1.47/ESP32-C6-Touch-LCD-1.47-Schematic.pdf); the overview pin table conflicts with the circuit |
| AMOLED 1.8, 2.06, 2.16 | Establish DCDC1 at 3.3 V; enable/check ALDO1 at 3.3 V before using ES8311 audio. XPowers initialization alone does not set these rails. | [1.8 power configuration](https://github.com/waveshareteam/waveshare_boards/blob/main/boards/esp32_s3_touch_amoled_1_8/power_manager.c), [2.06 schematic](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.06/blob/main/Schematic/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.06-Schematic-V1.0.pdf), [2.16 schematic](https://github.com/waveshareteam/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16/blob/main/schematic/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16-Schematic.pdf) |
| AMOLED 2.41 | Label the existing firmware V1, including installer/export labels. It must not be presented as V2-compatible. Asset identifiers remain unchanged. | [Revision differences](https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.41#v1-vs-v2-differences) |

The 1.8 expander has no concurrent runtime output writers in the current call graph: system/display
initialization precedes the input task, and touch recovery is its only runtime writer. Each reset
edge reads the current latch/direction state. No additional mutex or hardware wrapper is needed.

Touch IRQ handlers are detached while the sampler is paused. Light-sleep cleanup disables the
normal GPIO interrupt trigger as well as its wake source: ESP-IDF's wake setup changes that trigger
to level-sensitive, and a later Arduino `pinMode` can otherwise re-enable it. The app finishes its
wake-contact reads before resuming the sampler, avoiding concurrent touch reset/read operations.

The pending flags use only aligned 32-bit atomic loads/stores. These compile to native instructions
on the installed ESP32-S3 and C6 toolchains. Do not substitute exchange/fetch/CAS: the installed S3
framework disables hardware read-modify-write atomics, even though word loads/stores remain native.

## Aligned rendering and orientation

The existing UI primitives compose complete opaque regions into one reusable native Arduino_GFX
32-row canvas before sending aligned rectangles. There is no full-screen framebuffer, panel
readback, retained draw-command list, or second UI model. The existing LCD 3.49 AXS15231B
canvas/row-prefix implementation and C6 direct drawing path do not compile this strip buffer.

The panel controllers impose restrictions independently of SPI DMA alignment:

| Controller | Documented update window | Existing supported boards |
|---|---|---|
| SH8601 | Even X/Y starts and even width/height; window and image dimensions must agree (pp. 107, 109). | AMOLED 1.8 V1 |
| CO5300 | Even starts and even spans (pp. 159, 161). | AMOLED 1.8 V2, 2.06, 2.16 |
| RM690B0 | Even starts and even spans (pp. 73-74). | AMOLED 2.41 V1 |

[RM690B0 datasheet](https://files.waveshare.com/wiki/common/RM690B0_DataSheet_V0.3_20210105_(Public_version).pdf).

Arduino_GFX forwards arbitrary primitive windows. Rounding their coordinates alone would supply
the wrong number of pixels or overwrite neighbours. The remote V2 diagnostic showed missing
one-row/one-column primitives and corrupt odd-height transfers; the working aligned reference
does not establish that arbitrary UI drawing works.

### What the linked projects actually do

- [Pixelcat](https://github.com/toddsherman/pixelcat/blob/74af7d274de045493529d4b790f5f9bb9d5bd976/main/display.c#L31-L37)
  uses two 368 x 28 RGB565 DMA bands, 41,216 bytes total, not a full framebuffer. Each band is
  composed before its complete aligned transfer. Its drawing code supplies all the band's pixels.
- [Buddy](https://github.com/vthinkxie/claude-desktop-buddy-esp32/blob/61a0ce9f7410ed87de2032f226e511c9e59abbfe/src/hw/display.cpp#L119-L229)
  uses an Arduino canvas. Its 1.8 target is SH8601 V1, with an 184 x 224 canvas upscaled using
  one-row writes. Those writes conflict with the documented SH8601 restriction; they do not prove
  that CO5300 V2 supports them. Its CO5300 letterbox path describes per-row failures and uses a
  physical-frame buffer.
- [Waveshare BSP 2.0.3](https://github.com/waveshareteam/Waveshare-ESP32-components/blob/9f4030c6e5cb888ad4cc268bfa7584c93ad53e30/bsp/esp32_s3_touch_amoled_1_8/esp32_s3_touch_amoled_1_8.c#L388-L416)
  rounds LVGL invalidated areas **before** LVGL draws the matching pixels. Partial buffers are
  sufficient. The [V2 16-pixel offset](https://components.espressif.com/components/waveshare/esp32_s3_touch_amoled_1_8/versions/2.0.3/readme)
  already matches this firmware; 2.06's 22-pixel offset also matches the vendor implementation.
- The Arduino_GFX maintainer [recommends Canvas for this symptom](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX/issues/780#issuecomment-3969734606).
  That workaround does not establish that hardware readback is impossible.

### Strip composition

The existing tester videos establish successful aligned two-row transfers. Widgets now own aligned
rectangles and repaint all pixels within them, including the background. Changed page highlights
recompose the affected ink bounds with neighboring words; shaping, pagination and input handling
are not replayed for each strip. Existing font objects and caches are reused. Standby animations
advance once per update and keep their existing dirty-cell tracking.

Widget text is prepared once per changed region, before strip composition. Page layout stores
exact ink bounds and bidi positions in its existing words/lines, so invisible words can be skipped
before changing fonts. Unknown bounds remain conservative if font reads fail. Counter-rotated
glyphs decode only visible source rows/columns. A clipped 2 x 2 test reads two rows instead of twelve.

Opaque reader regions skip the redundant clear before composition; partial custom drawings retain
their clear. Carousel selection uses existing card signatures instead of invalidating the screen.
Cards and dock items share their drawing/touch slot. The hourglass computes its outline once and
rejects invisible segments without changing their rasterization: the 120 x 80 landscape regression
drops from 10,080 outline calls to 480 with identical pixels.

Removing the redundant packed-pixel color table saves 1,024 bytes per font renderer. Cached page
geometry adds 8 bytes per word and 4 per bidi character, plus line bounds; it is not a claim that
total working memory always decreases. No additional font objects or pixel buffers are created.

| Board | Default UI size | 32-row RGB565 allocation |
|---|---|---|
| AMOLED 1.8 V1/V2 | 448 x 368 | 23,552 bytes |
| AMOLED 2.06 | 502 x 410 | 26,368 bytes |
| AMOLED 2.16 | 480 x 480 | 30,720 bytes |
| AMOLED 2.41 V1 | 600 x 450 | 28,928 bytes |
| C6 LCD 1.47 | 320 x 172 | None |

The row pitch rounds up to four pixels for Arduino_Canvas's allocation alignment. Transfer payloads
are packed to the actual window width. AMOLED panels remain at native rotation zero; the native
canvas rotates each strip and the existing touch transform follows the same orientation. The
left-handed setting selects the opposite landscape orientation. Board configuration selects the
path at compile time; the regular LCD 3.49 layout is unchanged.

The 32-row setting replaces the two-row allocation in that same canvas. On the 1.8 a full-screen
paint needs 14 callbacks/transfers instead of 224, with the same total pixel payload. The final
band sends only the remaining even rows. This reduces repeated drawing and window setup without
adding asynchronous buffer ownership or a second allocation. It is not a measured frame-rate claim.
RSVP region bounds remain unchanged: centering metrics do not bound every shaped glyph or phantom.

Arduino_GFX is pinned to the audited revision. Its u8g2 decoder used unsigned temporary coordinates,
which dropped glyph fragments crossing the strip edge. `tools/pio_gfx.py` builds a generated copy
with signed coordinates; it does not modify the dependency cache. Full logical text bounds let
the native canvas clip scaled glyph pixels correctly. The native-library regression compares real
u8g2/Canvas output against a full-canvas reference, independently of the UI test double.

Panel read-modify-write was investigated but is not used: it adds serial reads,
turnarounds and controller-specific uncertainty to drawing that can use small write-only strips.
[SiFli's CO5300 read implementation](https://github.com/OpenSiFli/SiFli-SDK/blob/575742f27c2c133421fe6759e952bdaad766c417/customer/peripherals/display/co5300/co5300.c#L413-L469)
is a real implementation lead on another MCU, not a verified Waveshare solution. No additional
readback diagnostic is needed to re-establish the already-observed aligned-transfer behavior.

## Deliberate differences and unresolved evidence

- Keep the contaminated LCD 3.49 touch-IRQ connection on its established polling path. AMOLED
  2.41 V1 also polls: touch IRQ is EXIO2 and the expander's interrupt output is unconnected.
- CST9220 post-read acknowledgement differs between Arduino (`D0 00 AB`) and BSP references.
  No unconditional ACK was added without exact-controller evidence or a physical trace.
- Do not copy 2.16's `MADCTL=0xA0` independently of the reference's paired touch transform.
  Arduino_GFX's CO5300 mirror constants also differ from the datasheet. Strip rotation keeps
  the panel at rotation zero, without relying on those unverified mirror values.
- Existing display sleep delays are not proven wrong merely because another example uses longer
  delays or avoids sleep. Charging, other PMU rails, minimum brightness, output-only audio and
  accelerometer-only operation are unchanged.
- I2S, IMU and storage pin assignments matched the inspected schematics. Feature differences
  from demonstration projects are not wiring defects.

## Physical acceptance checks

Build/host tests cannot replace these checks on each affected revision:

- Cold boot after power removal; read back system/audio rail configuration and confirm audio output.
- Touch tap/drag/stationary hold/release, a pulse between sampling deadlines, failed-read retry,
  recovery reset, and repeated standby wake without an interrupt storm.
- On 1.8, reset touch while display and SD remain undisturbed; verify only EXIO2 toggles.
- On C6, verify BOOT actions and BOOT/touch wake.
- Test the regular firmware's menus, keyboard, RSVP/page/CJK reading, chapter changes, focus timers
  and standby animations. Check both handedness settings, corner touch targets, partial updates
  and scrolling. Confirm redraw speed and readability on the physical display.

## Local verification

- All 267 native cases passed across the regular UI, watch UI, aligned-rendering, board-wiring,
  light-sleep and existing firmware suites. The final rendering recheck includes exact transfer
  counts, clipped/odd regions, touch rotation, incremental highlights, keyboard invalidation,
  screensavers and moved/removed widget ownership.
- The native Arduino_GFX regression passes 1,536 cases at 2/16/32/64 rows across the four AMOLED
  panel sizes and two smaller, padded/short-tail surfaces. Each case compares single-line and
  newline output, with and without prepared-text clipping. Omitting full logical text bounds
  fails 838 cases. Run `python test/native_canvas/run.py --fetch-library`.
- `checkWeb` and the production installer bundle passed. Committed conflict markers and a duplicate
  import in the USB regression test were removed without discarding its book-deletion check.
- The firmware-export script passed its syntax check.
- No physical board tests were performed during this audit.
