# RSVP Nano Conversion Specification

## Purpose

This specification defines how RSVP Nano converters transform supported source documents into
`.rsvp` files. All converter implementations must either conform to this specification or document
their limitations explicitly.

The authoritative behavior is verified with reference test cases under `testdata/conversion`.

## Output Format

Generated `.rsvp` files are UTF-8 text files with `\n` line endings.

Every generated file must start with:

```text
@rsvp 1
@title <title>
@source <source>
```

`@author <author>` should be included when the source provides a non-empty author.

Readable content follows the header. Lines are wrapped at 96 characters without splitting long
words. Readable lines that begin with `@` must be escaped by prefixing an additional `@`.

## Directives

| Directive | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@rsvp 1` | Yes | Declares RSVP file format version 1. |
| `@title <value>` | Yes | Display title for the reader UI. |
| `@source <value>` | Yes | Original filename or URL. |
| `@author <value>` | No | Display author when known. |
| `@converter <value>` | No | Converter/cache identifier, mainly for firmware-generated cache files. |
| `@language <BCP 47 tag>` | No | Changes the language of following readable text until another language directive. |
| `@direction auto\|ltr\|rtl` | No | Changes the logical text direction of following readable text. |
| `@writing-mode vertical-rl` | No | Marks a book that should use vertical right-to-left layout. Horizontal layout is the default. |
| `@chapter <value>` | No | Chapter marker used for navigation and progress. |
| `@para` | No | Marks the next readable word as the start of a paragraph. |
| `@@...` | As needed | Escaped readable text line that starts with `@`. |

Converters should emit `@chapter` whenever reliable chapter structure is available. If no chapter
is available, converters should insert one fallback chapter based on the document title.

Converters should emit `@para` for each logical paragraph after readable text has already begun.
Chapter boundaries imply a paragraph boundary for the following readable text.

Language and direction directives are state changes. Converters must emit a new directive when a
nested source element changes either value, then restore the previous value after that element.
Repeated adjacent state directives should be omitted. Language tags must use valid, normalized BCP
47 spelling with `-` separators. Text must remain in logical Unicode order. Converters must not
reverse bidirectional text or replace characters with presentation forms because the reader owns
bidirectional layout and shaping.

## Supported Inputs

### Convert To RSVP

- `.epub`
- `.txt`
- `.md`
- `.markdown`
- `.html`
- `.htm`
- `.xhtml`
- `.pdf`

### Pass Through

- `.rsvp`

### Firmware Fallback

The firmware can read or convert a narrower set directly:

- `.rsvp`
- `.txt`
- `.epub`
- `.pdf`

### Share And Draft Inputs

- URLs
- Plain text
- Text-like files: `.txt`, `.md`, `.markdown`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.xhtml`
- Document files: `.epub`, `.pdf`

## Text And Markdown Rules

- Decode text using the supported runtime decoder chain.
- Blank lines separate paragraphs.
- Markdown is treated as plain text with lightweight heading detection.
- Lines beginning with `#`, `Chapter`, `Part`, or `Book` are chapter candidates when the cleaned
  line is short enough to be a title.
- Full Markdown rendering is not currently part of the contract.

## HTML And XHTML Rules

- Ignore `head`, `math`, `nav`, `script`, `style`, and `svg`.
- Treat block elements as paragraph boundaries.
- Treat `h1` through `h6` as chapter markers.
- Decode named and numeric HTML entities.
- Collapse repeated whitespace inside each output paragraph.
- Preserve inline text order across nested spans and inline elements.

## EPUB Rules

- Read `META-INF/container.xml` to locate the OPF package file.
- Use OPF metadata title when present.
- Use OPF metadata creator as author when present.
- Build the manifest from OPF `item` entries.
- Prefer OPF spine reading order.
- Support both EPUB2 NCX and EPUB3 navigation documents.
- Prefer EPUB2 NCX labels for EPUB2 packages and EPUB3 navigation document labels for EPUB3
  packages. If the preferred TOC source is unavailable or empty, converters may fall back to the
  other TOC source.
- Resolve percent-encoded manifest, spine, TOC, and fragment references before matching them to ZIP
  entries or XHTML `id` / `name` anchors.
- Flatten nested TOC entries into reading order for `@chapter` output.
- Preserve multiple TOC entries that point to different anchors in the same content document; apply
  those labels in TOC order instead of collapsing them to one label per file.
- Ignore non-content TOC labels such as cover, title page, table of contents, and labels matching
  the book title.
- If the spine is missing or empty, a converter may fall back to manifest content documents.
- Content documents are selected by media type (`application/xhtml+xml`, `text/html`) or by
  `.xhtml`, `.html`, or `.htm` extension.
- Each selected content document is processed using the HTML/XHTML rules.
- Preserve valid `xml:lang` or `lang` changes as scoped `@language` directives.
- Preserve `dir="auto"`, `dir="ltr"`, and `dir="rtl"` changes as scoped `@direction` directives.
- Use the package language as the initial language when the content document does not declare one.
- Emit one book-level `@writing-mode vertical-rl` directive when the package or readable content
  declares vertical right-to-left writing. Do not repeat it for individual elements.
- If a readable content document is mapped by the EPUB TOC, the output chapter marker must use
  that TOC label and must not duplicate the document's first heading.
- If one readable content document contains several TOC-mapped chapters, generated `@chapter`
  markers should follow the ordered TOC labels and should replace short in-body headings such as
  bare Roman numerals.
- If an EPUB TOC is sparse and does not map readable body content documents, reliable in-body
  headings from those unmapped documents should still be preserved as chapter markers.
- If an EPUB TOC is available, readable content documents that are not mapped by the TOC must not
  receive generated filename chapter markers.
- Generated title pages and table-of-contents pages should not become chapter markers when a
  better TOC or body chapter structure is available.
- If no usable EPUB TOC is available and a readable content document has no heading, insert a
  chapter marker from its filename.
- EPUBs with `META-INF/encryption.xml` must fail with a clear unsupported-conversion error rather
  than attempting to emit partially readable or corrupt text.

## PDF Rules

- Extract selectable text only. PDF conversion does not rasterize pages and does not perform OCR.
- Process pages in document order and preserve the extractor's logical Unicode and paragraph order.
- Use document title and author metadata when they are non-empty. Use the source filename as the
  title fallback.
- Do not infer language, direction, chapters, or writing mode when the PDF does not expose reliable
  structure for them.
- Insert one fallback chapter based on the resolved document title.
- A PDF with no decodable text must fail with a clear error instead of producing an empty book.
- Composite or custom-encoded PDF fonts require a usable Unicode character map such as
  `ToUnicode`. A converter must reject undecodable text rather than emit character codes as text.
- PDF font programs and font selections are extraction details. They are not copied into the RSVP
  file. Required writing scripts are derived later from the extracted Unicode text while the
  reader builds its index.
- Reading order is necessarily limited by the PDF's text objects and tagging. Visually positioned
  documents may require conversion on a computer or a corrected source document.

## Text Normalization

Converters should normalize text consistently:

- Collapse repeated whitespace to a single space.
- Normalize common smart quotes, dashes, ellipses, non-breaking spaces, and ligatures.
- Preserve punctuation in output, including punctuation-only inline fragments.
- Count words using readable tokens containing at least one letter or digit.
- Keep CJK text as readable phrase tokens without inserting artificial spaces between adjacent CJK
  tokens.
- Preserve directive safety by escaping readable lines that begin with `@`.

## Encoding

Converters should support these text, HTML, and EPUB encodings where the runtime allows it:

- UTF-8 with or without BOM.
- UTF-16 with BOM.
- UTF-16 XML-like documents without BOM.
- Windows-1252.
- ISO-8859-1 / Latin-1.

Unsupported or undecodable sources should fail with a clear conversion error rather than silently
producing empty output.

PDF character decoding is handled by the PDF extractor and its embedded font mappings. The text
encoding fallback chain above does not apply to PDF object streams.

## Runtime Responsibilities

| Runtime | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Kotlin Multiplatform `:conversionCore` | Source implementation for Android, iOS, and Kotlin/Wasm. |
| Compose web companion | Browser file selection and conversion through `:conversionCore`. |
| Firmware C++ | Constrained on-device fallback and RSVP parser. |

Runtime-specific APIs such as file pickers, storage, and firmware cache management may differ. The
Kotlin implementation should use shared ZIP and DOM parsing through `:conversionCore` where
possible. The resulting `.rsvp` output should still match the reference test cases unless a runtime
limitation is documented.

The Kotlin PDF converter uses the shared `pdf-core` API backed by PDFium on each target. Browser
builds package the PDFium runtime beside the application and test bundles.

The firmware converter streams EPUB content to keep memory use bounded. It currently accepts UTF-8
EPUB package and XHTML content; UTF-16, Windows-1252, and Latin-1 transcoding remain limited to the
companion conversion runtimes. Streaming also means the firmware cannot retroactively discard an
entire generated title or contents document after parsing it; it still suppresses navigation
subtrees and non-content chapter headings while parsing. Firmware PDF conversion is also a
constrained fallback and may reject documents that exceed its memory or supported PDF feature
limits. Desktop or browser conversion remains the preferred path for complex PDFs.

## Parity Requirements

- New converter behavior requires a reference test case.
- Reference test cases must cover representative text, Markdown, HTML/XHTML, EPUB, PDF, existing
  `.rsvp` pass-through, directive escaping, paragraphs, chapters, Unicode normalization,
  punctuation preservation, language changes, bidirectional text, CJK tokenization, and vertical
  writing.
- `:conversionCore` common and browser tests should exercise the shared reference fixtures.
- Firmware conversion behavior should use the same fixtures where its constrained extraction path applies.
- Output comparisons should normalize line endings only; content differences are failures.
